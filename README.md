## Distinctiveness and Complexity

The seven service website it's not a social media app nor an e-commerce, and it's not similar to other yearâ€™s final projects, so the distinctiveness of this website resides in the main idea and objective itself, since as mentioned above the main idea behind this website is to focus on the categories of services offered to Iraqi users, and offers presented by seven service company about each service in addition to writing blogs that contains  a detailed information, image and video about for example how to maintain and ensure the safety  the services installed in each house by seven service company. 
Thus, In terms of complexity at the backend, Django is used to build models and views, and in terms of complexity in frontend a several JavaScript files are used for adding fantastic interactivity to web pages besides utilizing CSS files for making templets responsive to different screen sizes.
